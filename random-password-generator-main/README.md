# strong-password-generator

Notes: 
-> Generated passwords are viewable to the user only.
-> Colorama is an imported module.
-> Generated passwords can be viewed in the file generatedPasswords.log. This file will automatically appear after you run the code.
-> salts.txt is a text file where the program randomly chooses words in the file to add it to your hashed password. To add some salts to the file make sure you add each salt in a  separate line.
